The EEG signal is a measure of the electrical activity produced by a network of neurons in the
brain.
The billions of nerve cells in our brain produce very weak electrical signals, which form
patterns called brain waves. The EEG consists of placing small electrodes and wires on your
head. The electrode receives your brain waves, the EEG machine amplifies the signal and
records it as a graph on graph paper or a computer screen
There are several ways to perform an EEG
-Standard
-Dynamic
-Video
In this , we use a filter to filter the EEG signal to remove the frequency components
of the unwanted data from the original signal, and use FFT and wavelet transform to extract
attributes or information about the signal
